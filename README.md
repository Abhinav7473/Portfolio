# Portfolio

A case file documenting three systems where technical correctness diverged from practical utility.

**Live site:** [abhinav7473.github.io/Portfolio](https://abhinav7473.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Projects documented

1. **RT-MTCP** — Traffic crash prediction under severe class imbalance
2. **Softeon AI Platform** — Enterprise support system interaction redesign
3. **CAN Intrusion Detection System** — Automotive intrusion detection system
4. **Warehouse Management System with 3D Visualization** — Spatial navigation for high-density storage

Built in a day as a constraint exercise in clarity over decoration.
