# Portfolio

A case file documenting three systems where technical correctness diverged from practical utility.

**Live site:** [abhinav7473.github.io/Portfolio](https://abhinav7473.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Structure

- Single-page, scroll-based layout
- Three project analyses focused on failure modes and corrective interventions
- Static HTML/CSS (no frameworks, no build step)

## Projects documented

1. **RT-MTCP** — Traffic crash prediction under severe class imbalance
2. **Softeon AI Platform** — Enterprise support system interaction redesign
3. **Warehouse 3D Visualization** — Spatial navigation for high-density storage

## Design principles

- Minimal cognitive load
- Content-first hierarchy  
- Restrained visual language
- No persuasive rhetoric

## Technical stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Inter typeface via Google Fonts)
- GitHub Pages deployment
