            <p class="lens">I'm interested in the point where systems technically succeed and practically fail.</p>
        </header>

        <section class="intro">
            <p>Most systems don't break in obvious ways. They degrade. They return correct outputs in the wrong sequence, present confidence where uncertainty would be more honest, and discourage exploration by making deviation expensive. I tend to notice hesitation—when someone pauses, rereads, or second-guesses an interface they were supposed to trust. That pause usually isn't user error. It's a signal.</p>

            <h2>RT-MTCP: Real-Time Multi-Target Traffic Crash Prediction</h2>
            
            <div class="context">
                <p>Urban crash prediction models are typically optimized for aggregate accuracy, implicitly treating all errors as equally costly. In practice, they aren't.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="breakdown">
                <h3>Failure mode</h3>
                <p>Under extreme class imbalance, existing models performed well on global metrics while underrepresenting low-frequency, high-impact crashes. These cases were statistically minor but operationally significant, producing stable scores while obscuring scenarios planners are most sensitive to.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="breakdown">
                <h3>Intervention</h3>
                <p>I reoriented the modeling and evaluation pipeline toward reliability under stress rather than mean performance. Emphasis shifted to minority-class recall, with gradient boosting and Bayesian smoothing used to retain rare patterns instead of averaging them away. Evaluation was structured to surface failure cases rather than absorb them into aggregate scores.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="breakdown">
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>Minority-class recall increased by 22–37%. The resulting signals were less stable on paper but better aligned with how risk is interpreted in downstream planning and emergency-response contexts.</p>

            <h2>AI Support Platform at Softeon</h2>
            
            <div class="context">
                <p>Enterprise support agents operate under time pressure, partial information, and shifting priorities. Many support tools respond by exposing more data, assuming volume compensates for clarity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="breakdown">
                <h3>Failure mode</h3>
                <p>Early versions surfaced correct information too late and without regard for role or context. Latency and dense outputs increased hesitation, misinterpretation, and unnecessary escalation. The issue wasn't correctness. It was timing and framing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="breakdown">
                <h3>Intervention</h3>
                <p>The interaction flow was redesigned around progressive disclosure. High-confidence knowledge surfaced first, followed by historical context. Dashboards were separated by role after observing how shared metrics were consistently misread. Configuration controls were exposed so behavior could be adjusted without engineering involvement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="breakdown">
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>The platform was adopted into daily workflows by 50+ users. Quality ratings improved from 88% to 98.6% over time, largely through iterative adjustments driven by observed breakdowns rather than feature expansion.</p>

            <h2>Warehouse Management System with 3D Visualization</h2>
            
            <div class="context">
                <p>Conventional WMS interfaces require operators to reconstruct physical space from tables, filters, and static diagrams. This works when time pressure is low. It doesn't scale to live operations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="breakdown">
                <h3>Failure mode</h3>
                <p>Critical decisions depended on abstract representations that made spatial reasoning slow and error-prone, particularly in dense storage environments. Operators spent effort translating views instead of acting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="breakdown">
                <h3>Intervention</h3>
                <p>I built a 3D digital twin using ArUco-based physical–digital synchronization, allowing the warehouse to be navigated as a continuous space. Real-time APIs and path optimization reduced context switching during active picking rather than adding another layer of abstraction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="breakdown">
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>Picker travel distance decreased by 12–18%. Spatial decisions became faster without introducing additional training overhead.</p>
